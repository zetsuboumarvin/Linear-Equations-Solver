Format of input data:  
N (number of variables) M (number of equations)  
x (coefficient of the first variable) ... z (coefficient of the last variable) A (result of equation)  
x (coefficient of the first variable) ... z (coefficient of the last variable) A (result of equation)  
...  
x (coefficient of the first variable) ... z (coefficient of the last variable) A (result of equation)  

Example:
```
3 3
2 3 5 10
3 7 4 3
1 2 2 3

equal for

3 variables and 3 equations
